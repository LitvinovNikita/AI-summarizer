Welcome to Summarize, an open-source article summarizer powered by OpenAI GPT-4. Our mission is to transform lengthy articles into clear, concise, and easy-to-read summaries.

## How it Works

The app condenses extensive content, retaining key information and presenting it in an easily digestible format. It's an ideal tool for those looking to enhance their reading efficiency, broaden their knowledge, or quickly get the gist of an article.
